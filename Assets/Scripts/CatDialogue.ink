# hide_cat
It was a long day. You're tired from work and your best friend couldn't join you for the evening. 
You're heading back to your lonely house, thinking about...
* [New TV series] Maybe you can check out that new show everyone's talking about.
* [A bottle of beer] Even from the street how you can hear that cold beer in the fridge is calling your name.
* [Playing a video game] You still need to beat that annoying boss. Blade of... what was his name again? 
- Yes. The evening probably won't be that bad after all.
Here's your house. And your porch. And your door. And your box. #show_cat # cat_inbox
    Wait a minute.... What box? You didn't order anything.
It's not Christmas and it's not your birthday. Maybe you should call the police?
Suddenly the box cries out in a thin voice. And then you hear some scratching. Before you have a chance to react... It opens. 
A cat! Somebody left a box with a cat on your porch. # cat_box
-> box_action


=== box_action ===
What do you want to do?
* [Look for a person who left the box] You look around â€” the street is empty. Probably that somebody is already far away. -> box_action
* [Leave the box outside and proceed with the initial plan] Well... It's not really an option here. We still have a game to play, don't we? -> box_action
* [Take the box home] You have a cat now. -> END
